## About Me ✨
I am a Computer Science Technician graduate and currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Co-op at Concordia University in Montreal. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for DevOps automation and enhancing developer experience, I am driven to create meaningful solutions that simplify workflows and improve efficiency. My goal is to continue exploring new technologies and contribute to open-source projects that empower developers, making their work easier and more impactful.

## 🚀 Featured Project:
### Project-Init

A developer-first CLI tool that eliminates project setup headaches. Instantly configure development databases, manage environments, and soon bootstrap production-ready FastAPI applications with best practices built-in. From zero to coding in minutes, not hours.

## 💼 Technical Expertise

As a student passionate about software development, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in areas such as DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and automation. Through independent research and hands-on work on personal projects, I've gained valuable experience in both frontend and backend technologies.

### Key Areas of Interest & Skills:
- **DevOps**: I am learning how to streamline development workflows using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, and I have a keen interest in automating tasks and integrating CI/CD pipelines with tools like **GitHub Actions**.
  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: My goal is to better understand cloud platforms like **AWS** and **DigitalOcean** to build scalable and secure environments for deployment and development.

- **Backend Development**: I have explored building APIs with **FastAPI** and **Express**, learning how to implement microservices and RESTful APIs that interact with various databases.

- **Frontend Development**: I am actively working with **React** and **Next.js** to develop interactive and responsive web applications, leveraging **TailwindCSS** for design.

- **Security**: I have built custom authentication systems, both for **Next.js** (using **NextAuth** as a base for credential authentication) and from scratch in **FastAPI**. I'm also expanding my knowledge in credential management, environment isolation, and authentication protocols like **JWT** and **OAuth2**.

I am continuously working to improve my skills through personal projects, research, and real-world application.
